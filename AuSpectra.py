At a minimum, there should be two options that the user can choose to control the output of the program. 
    1) No plot: type in file name to get info on spectrum (e.g. "sample A aggregated or is 58 nm based on correlation."
     can get the info as a table output. 
         a) normalized to highest value
         b) not normalized 
    2) Do #1 above AND plot all the spectra and label them. 
The info in #1 can just be attached to each spectrum rather than in a table, or both. 

TO DO:
1)put spectra in different csv files and label them. Put a test spectrum for now
